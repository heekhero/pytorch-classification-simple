# pytorch-classification-simple
### :boom: This is a repository for image classification in Pytorch with very very very simple code! It is a very suitable entry project for beginners to learn in terms of deep learning

In this repository, some important features of a deep classification model are written by the author manually instead of calling pytorch library directly e.g. the softmax cross entropy loss in training process and some connected dense blocks which are use to define the base architecture of netowrks.
